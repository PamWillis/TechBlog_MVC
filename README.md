# Description
    - This was created in order to have a better understanding of Model View Controller and how it all connects.
    - In creating I have a better understanding of the paths needed from front end to back end and how it calls rendering a page
    - This system allows me to keep the storage on a server instead of keeping everything local.
    - I learned by creating the event handlers, I can create a route the will call the information from the server and show the correct page that is created by handlebars.
